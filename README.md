# Quantum ALgorithms
In this repository we include the implementation of different quantum algorithms and error correction schemes using the cQASM programming language.

# Folders
Each of the folders H1, H2 and H3 contains a different set of quantum algorithms:
H1: Bell state measurement, Quantum Teleportation, Quantum Plain Adder, Carry Circuit, Sum Circuit and we study the Deutsch Algorithm for four different unitaries. 
H2: Shor's Algoritm, Steane 7-qubit code, and F-T Bell state measurement. 
H3: Ninja Star, Shor's algorithm encoding using different schedulers.

For more information, consult the corresponding .pdf files in each folder.

## Instructions to run the circuits

1. To install QX, run the following command on Anaconda/Linux Terminal
                                                                       
	>> pip install --default-timeout=100 qxelarator==0.5                                                                       

2. To execute and simulate the file, run the following command on Anaconda/Linux Terminal
                                                                       
	>> python run_cqasm.py <filename>.qc
